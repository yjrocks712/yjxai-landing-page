                        A comma (,) within a letter's set indicates a new, separate line segment within that letter.</p>

                        <p>Let ABCD be a tetrahedron such that AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. There exists a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form (m√n) / p, where m, n, and p are positive integers, m and p are relatively prime, and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find m + n + p.</p>
