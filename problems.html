                        <p>I have plotted points on a coordinate plane and connected them in a specific order to form letters. These letters together spell out a word. Below, I will provide the coordinates of the points and indicate which points are connected using a specific symbol. The points belonging to each letter will be enclosed within curly brackets {} to indicate they form a single letter. Your task is to identify each letter and determine the complete word.</p>
                        <p>Notation:<br>
                        Points are given as ordered pairs: (x, y).<br>
                        Connections between points are denoted by → (e.g., (2,3) → (4,3) means these two points are connected by a line segment).<br>
                        Each letter's points are enclosed in curly brackets {(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ...}.<br>
                        A comma (,) within a letter's set indicates a new, separate line segment within that letter.</p>
